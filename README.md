# BookShelf
Live Demo: 
## Description

The Bookshelf project is a web application aimed at helping users manage their personal book collections. Users can search for books by title and add them to their virtual bookshelves. The application allows users to view details about each book, including the title, author, and language. Additionally, users can organize their bookshelves and remove books they no longer wish to keep. The Bookshelf project is built using modern web technologies such as React.js for the front end. It is a Client-side rendering application so no server-side method is used. It provides a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality to enhance the book management experience for users.
